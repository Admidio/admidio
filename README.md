# Admidio

Admidio is a free open source user management system for websites of
organizations and groups. The system has a flexible role model so that
it’s possible to reflect the structure and permissions of your organization.
You can create an individual profile for your members by adding or removing
profile fields. Additional to these functions the system contains several modules
like member lists, event manager, messages, photo album or a documents & files area.
